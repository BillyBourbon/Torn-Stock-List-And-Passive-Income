# **__Torn-Stock-List-And-Passive-Income__**


**__About__**

This sheet was made by bilbosaggings[2323763] and is a completely free sheet/script (donations accepted ofc but not required)

This tool creates two sheets. one for your personal passive income from stocks and one for the torn stock list which shows their prices and the ROIs for each stock with a payout. Ill admit this sheet is rather poop so itll be updated to be less stinky at somepoint but in its current state it works and does its job well

4.
> Authorise the script
> follow the series of images below to authorize the script
> the script needs authorizing by the user (you) as its a custom script thats not been vetted by google.
> this scripts permissions can be found on the last image.
> to break this down quickly this allows the script to make requests to external services(TornAPI), run whilst your not around (Trigger to run the script daily at 1am), make edits to the sheet (hopefully this one is obvious as to why its needed :P)
